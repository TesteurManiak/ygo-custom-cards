# EDOPro Custom Cards

Custom cards that I've created for [EDOPro](edopro). These cards are not official and are not intended to be used in official tournaments.

Those cards were created and are managed using [YGOFabrica](ygofabrica).

## Installation

* Install and configure YGOFabrica: https://github.com/piface314/ygo-fabrica/wiki/Install
* Clone the repository
* Run the following commands to generate the cards:

```sh
ygofab make
ygofab sync
```

## Card list

* :white_check_mark: -> Fully scripted
* :large_orange_diamond: -> Partially scripted
* :x: -> Not scripted
